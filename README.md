# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits, attendance, academic background, and extracurricular activities.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Educational institutions often struggle to identify students at risk of failing before it's too late. This project builds a predictive model to classify students into **pass** or **fail** categories using key academic and behavioral data.

**Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
**Target Variable:** `Pass` (derived from GPA ≥ 2.0)

- `Age`, `Gender`, `Ethnicity`, `ParentalEducation`
- `StudyTimeWeekly`, `Absences`, `Tutoring`, `ParentalSupport`
- `Extracurricular`, `Sports`, `Music`, `Volunteering`
- `GPA` (used to compute the target)
